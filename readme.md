# KnotFolio

This is a program for manipulating and identifying knots and links.  The primary input method for diagrams is a kind of paint program with a special paintbrush that helps with drawing crossings.  You can also drag-and-drop images into the program, say a picture of a pencil, chalk, or whiteboard drawing.  Try it out at https://kmill.github.io/knotfolio/

## Acknowledgments

Thanks to ICERM for hosting the [Perspectives on Dehn Surgery](https://icerm.brown.edu/topical_workshops/tw19-3-pods/) summer school, where Stefan MihajloviÄ‡ asked whether there existed any programs for importing knot diagrams from papers, and where Ken Baker and Nathan Dunfield were helpful while I worked on the first prototype.

Some UI ideas came from [KLO](http://KLO-Software.net) and Josh Horowitz's [knot identification tool](http://joshuahhh.com/projects/kit/).

Knot identification uses the invaluable KnotInfo and LinkInfo databases:

* C. Livingston and A. H. Moore, KnotInfo: Table of Knot Invariants, https://knotinfo.math.indiana.edu, April 17, 2021.

* C. Livingston and A. H. Moore, LinkInfo: Table of Link Invariants, https://linkinfo.sitehost.iu.edu, April 17, 2021.

The program was written with support of the Simons Foundation and NSF RTG grant DMS-1344991.

## Running code locally

**Note**: This is out of date.  The most recent release uses `rollup`, and `npx rollup --config` creates `bundle.js`.

The `knotinfo` module is very large, which causes the JavaScript bundler to eat an extremely large amount of memory.  This requires the use of an option for `node` to allow more memory when running `parcel`:
```
NODE_OPTIONS=--max_old_space_size=4096 parcel index.html
```
A "production" bundle can be created in the `dist` folder with
```
NODE_OPTIONS=--max_old_space_size=4096 parcel build index.html --public-url ./
```

The command `npm test` runs some tests.
