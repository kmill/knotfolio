Things to compute:

- [X] Alexander polynomial
- [X] Jones polynomial
- [X] Writhe of diagram
- [X] crossing number of diagram
- [X] Turaev genus of diagram
- [X] +-adequate, --adequate, and adequateness of diagram
- [ ] HOMFLY polynomial
- [ ] Khovanov homology?
- [X] signature
- [X] DT code for knots
- [ ] is there a face with a braid axis?

Manipulations:

- [ ] cablings (like longitudinal pushoff)
- [ ] Whitehead doubling

Input methods:

- [ ] pretzels
- [ ] braid closures
- [ ] rational knots

Maybe change?

- in the image loader, make the image centered
- for alexander polynomial, use bignums since gcd can have overflows
- for Wirtinger presentation, make it be less agressive with substitution, since the relation words grow exponentially, especially with large alternating knots!  This could be through an artificial limit in the size of words, or it could be using a different representation of words of conjugates.
