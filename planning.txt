Things to compute:

- Alexander polynomial
- Jones polynomial
- Writhe of diagram
- Turaev genus of diagram
- +-adequate, --adequate, and adequateness of diagram
- HOMFLY polynomial
- crossing number of diagram
- Khovanov homology?
- signature

Manipulations:

- cablings (like longitudinal pushoff)
- Whitehead doubling


Maybe change?

- in the image loader, make the image centered
- when loading too big images, the way the canvas is used cuts off the image
- for alexander polynomial, use bignums since gcd can have overflows
