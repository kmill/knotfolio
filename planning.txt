Things to compute:

- [X] Alexander polynomial
- [X] Jones polynomial
- [X] Writhe of diagram
- [X] crossing number of diagram
- [X] Turaev genus of diagram
- [X] +-adequate, --adequate, and adequateness of diagram
- [ ] HOMFLY polynomial
- [ ] Khovanov homology?
- [X] signature
- [ ] DT code for knots
- [ ] is there a face with a braid axis?

Manipulations:

- [ ] cablings (like longitudinal pushoff)
- [ ] Whitehead doubling


Maybe change?

- in the image loader, make the image centered
- for alexander polynomial, use bignums since gcd can have overflows
